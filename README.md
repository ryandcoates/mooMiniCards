# mooMiniCards Template

I got asked for a repo of my Moo Mini Cards, so here are the photoshop files I use

I created these a few years ago prior to heading to [PowerShell summit](https://powershell.org/summit/) and people have always enjoyed them

## 2019
I created a new batch this year using the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/) color scheme and my favorite console font [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## Customizing 

1. Font size is set to 12 on the back, you may need to adjust and recenter depending on your data

2. Stay within the safe area guide line (layers included), but remember to hide those layers prior to the next step

3. I export a JPG for upload to [MOO](https://www.moo.com/us/)
